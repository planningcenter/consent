# Horizontal Main Nav

- layout for navigating a page's `main` content.
- Provides one of several ways to navigate`main` content.
- Tailored for a non-responsive, horizontal-scrolling experience with included areas for links and actions.

## Complete sample

Below is a full expression of Horizontal Main Nav with action buttons and standard accessibility considerations. This markup can be copy-pasted into into any of our supported development environments.

<Canvas>
  <SampleContainer>
    <div data-horizontal-main-nav--container>
      <nav aria-label="Resource">
        <ul data-horizontal-main-nav--link-group>
          <li>
            <a data-horizontal-main-nav--link aria-current="page" href="#">
              Current
            </a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a data-horizontal-main-nav--link href="#">
              Occluded
            </a>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </nav>
      <div data-horizontal-main-nav--action-group>
        <button data-horizontal-main-nav--action type="button">
          Action 1
        </button>
        <button data-horizontal-main-nav--action type="button">
          Action 2
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  </SampleContainer>
</Canvas>

## Installation

```bash
yarn add @planningcenter/grids@latest
```

Integration:

```js
// Most JS envs
import "@planningcenter/grids/dist/grids.css";
```

```css
/* Sprockets */
/*= require @planningcenter/grids/dist/grids.css */
```

```scss
// sass (leave extension off)
@import "@planningcenter/grids/dist/grids";
```

_(These integrations assume `node_modules/@planningcenter` is available in `assets.rb` or `application.rb` in Planning Center apps. If it is not, it will need to be added.)_

## Implementation considerations

- Horizontal Main Nav is designed exclusively for the navgation of a page's `main` content
  - Its styling is are not shared with in-content tabs
- All Main Nav subclasses should be included inside the `<main>` tag and and available after `Skip to main`
- Do not including links that a user can not access e.g., disabled
- This implementation avoids visually-exclusive language like "tab" and "bubble" in favor of information architectur terms
  - Avoiding visual terms better validates the screen-reader experience
  - Avoiding visual terms better inoculates this grid from future stylistic changes
  - An obvious exception is the use of `Horizontal` — used to disambigate this grid from other visual experiences for the Main Navs subclass
